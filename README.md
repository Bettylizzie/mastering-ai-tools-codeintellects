# AI Toolkit Project: Mastering Machine Learning Frameworks
##  Project Description
This project demonstrates the practical application of three major AI/ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and spaCy) through three distinct tasks:

## 1. Classical ML with scikit-learn (Iris Classification)
###  What it does:

Trains a Decision Tree classifier to predict iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on sepal/petal measurements.

Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Visualizes the decision-making process of the model via a decision tree diagram.

Files: iris_classification.ipynb, iris_dataset.csv

## 2. Deep Learning with TensorFlow (MNIST Digit Recognition)
### What it does:

Builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

Achieves >95% test accuracy through optimized architecture.

Visualizes predictions on sample images to show model performance.


## 3. NLP with spaCy (African Tech Sentiment Analyzer)
   ### What it does:

Analyzes sentiment in reviews of African tech products (e.g., M-Pesa, Jumia, Flutterwave).

Uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect African brands and products.

Applies weighted sentiment scoring (context-aware for African markets).

Generates visual reports of sentiment trends.


## Key Features
End-to-End ML Pipeline: Covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Framework Comparison: Highlights strengths of scikit-learn (classical ML) vs. TensorFlow (deep learning).
Real-World Focus: African tech sentiment analysis adds unique domain relevance.
Explainability: Decision tree visualizations and sample predictions make models interpretable.

### How It Works
### For Iris Classification:

Input: Sepal/petal length/width → Output: Iris species prediction.

### For MNIST Digit Recognition:

Input: Handwritten digit image (28×28 pixels) → Output: Predicted digit (0-9).

### For Sentiment Analysis:

Input: Product review text → Output: Sentiment score (-1 to +1) + detected entities.
